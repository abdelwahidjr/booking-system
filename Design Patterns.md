# Design Pattern

## Factory Pattern

- Creation-al Pattern

```
The Factory pattern is based on creating template method objects,
which is based on defining the algorithm of a class in a subclass
to implement an algorithm.
There is a subclass,
which is derived from a big superclass,in this pattern structure.
The main class, which we may call a superclass,
only holds major and generic logic;
the subclasses are derived from this superclass.
As a result, there may be more than 
one subclass inherited from this superclass,
which are aimed at different purposes.
```
## Observer Pattern
   
- Behavioral Pattern

```
Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects
so that when one object changes state,
all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically
